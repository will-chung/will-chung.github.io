### About Me

I decided to major in Computer Science because it is the field where I see the most opportunities and potential for me to make a difference. I am minoring in Mathematics because, among other things, the critical-thinking skills it teaches me are invaluable. Of course, I also find both subjects to be endlessly fascinating, and I want to one day apply the knowledge I am learning now, and which I will continue to learn, to become a software engineer solving the problems of today and tomorrow. It is still very early on in my journey, however, so until that day comes, I will devote myself to preparing for it. 

In the words of Seneca: 

> *The greatest obstacle to living is expectation, which depends on tomorrow and wastes today.*

Translation to code:
```
while(true) {
    myLife.liveInPresent();
}
```
